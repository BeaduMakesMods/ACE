# ACE
Ever wanted to use a repeating command block... with your own client? You could just use the execute command, yeah, but it's wayyy easier to just download a mod, probably change your Minecraft version, and a thousand more things!

Yes, this is a mod for lazy people who will do a lot right now, to not do a lot in the future.

Disclaimer: This mod runs a specified command every tick when enabled.
#

# To use,
Press the keybind (default N), or use Mod Menu, to open the config screen. Once opened, the config screen will include a text box, where you put the command, and a button.
To start you will need to specify your command in the text box, and press "start". When started, it will load the command for about 6~sec, and then start.
#

## MAKE SURE YOUR COMMAND DOES NOT RENDER YOURSELF UNABLE TO DISABLE THE MOD (e.g. "/kill @p", "/kick @p", "/ban @p"...)


## YOU COULD GET BANNED OR KICKED FOR "SPAMMING" IF YOU USE THIS MOD. MAKE SURE THE SERVER ALLOWS THE MOD BEFORE YOU USE IT!


## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
